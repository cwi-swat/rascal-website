title: "Rascal 0.7.x release notes"
---

In this post we report on the Rascal release 0.7.0. We expect a number of patch releases as well, which we report on by updating this post at the end when necessary. The Rascal release includes the following main components:

* Parser and interpreter
* Parser generator
* Eclipse plugin
* Eclipse plugin generator for DSLs
* Rascal commandline shell
* Standard library
* Programming language front-end library

Compared to 0.6.x the 0.7 release is mainly a bug fix release, with a number of extensions to the libraries and one new language feature. 

* The new language feature is keyword parameters for both functions and data constructors. 
* In terms of library funcionality the big new things is *M3*, a common intermediate format for facts about source code. This includes a standard set of relations (containment, def/use, etc.) and a preferred way of modeling abstract syntax trees.

### M3

### Keyword parameters

### Looking forward to the 0.8.x, 0.9.x and 1.0 releases
