# Tutorial: Program Analysis and Transformation with Rascal (PLDI 2015)

This is the landing page for the tutorial "Program Analysis and Transformation
with Rascal" that is being given this year at PLDI 2015 on the afternoon of
Saturday, January 13th. More information will be added to this page soon. If
you are interested in learning more about and/or downloading Rascal, you can
visit the Rascal homepage at http://www.rascal-mpl.org/.

## Tutorial Abstract

[Rascal] is a meta-programming language that combines a familiar Java-like
syntax with a powerful collection of built-in data types and language
features, including relations with relational algebra operators, extensive
support for pattern matching, higher-order functions, and fix-point
computation. Rascal is currently being used to develop program analysis tools
for languages such as Java, PHP, and Lua; to create domain-specific languages
for domains such as gaming and digital forensics; to create large-scale
program transformations; and to extract metrics across large collections of
software systems.

In this tutorial, we will first create a small language and define several
elementary operations, like counting operator uses and performing simple
program transformations. Next we will introduce the Metrics Meta Model (M3),
which models information related to source code, and show how it can be used
to define operations on Java and PHP such as measuring methods per class,
counting cast statements, measuring if-nesting and computing the McCabe
complexity. Finally, we will sketch a larger scale program transformation on
real Java code: how to convert code using the visitor pattern into code that
uses the interpreter pattern. The tutorial concludes with a brief sketch of
current and future developments of the Rascal language and its ecosystem.

*Expected Audience:* This tutorial will be appropriate for both researchers
and practitioners. Previous experience with tools for computing software
metrics and for performing analysis and transformation is recommended but is
not mandatory.
